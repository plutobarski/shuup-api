# API Usage

The API is JSON based, so you might expect the content type `application/json` from each response.

**Note**: *We really encourage you to only use the API through a secure connection (HTTPs) to avoid several cyber attacks.*

First of all, let's configure the Django Settings. This is an example of settings snippet:

```py
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',
        'shuup_api.authentication.ExpiringTokenAuthentication',
    ),
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
        'shuup_api.permissions.ShuupAPIPermission',
    )
}
```

We use the [**JSON Web Token**](https://github.com/GetBlimp/django-rest-framework-jwt) authentication method to avoid sending the username/e-mail and password on each request.

**Note**: *The following commands were generated using [**HTTPie**](https://httpie.org/), an awesome command line HTTP client. We are cropping the JSON Token as our main purpose here is the usage itself.*

To fetch objects from Shuup consider installing also [**Shuup REST API*](https://github.com/shuup/shuup-rest-api).

So, the first step is to authenticate and fetch a valid JSON Token to use on further requests:


```shell
> http POST http://localhost:8000/api/api-token-auth/ username=admin password=admin

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Allow: POST, OPTIONS
Content-Language: en
Content-Type: application/json
Vary: Accept, Accept-Language, Cookie
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

{
    "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."
}
```

Now we've got our token to use on further requests. Note that this token has a expiration time (by default it is 5 minutes).
This way, we should always refresh our token before it becomes invalid. To refresh our token, simply do:


```shell
> http POST http://localhost:8000/api/api-token-refresh/ token="eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Allow: POST, OPTIONS
Content-Language: en
Content-Type: application/json
Vary: Accept, Accept-Language, Cookie
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

{
    "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."
}
```

**Note**: *Remember to fresh the token before each* `JWT_EXPIRATION_DELTA` *minutes.*

Now it is time to use our token to make useful things. Let's fetch Product Types:

```shell
> http GET http://localhost:8000/api/shuup/product_type/ Authorization:"JWT YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Allow: GET, POST, OPTIONS
Content-Language: en
Content-Type: application/json
Vary: Accept, Accept-Language, Cookie
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

[
    {
        "attributes": [],
        "id": 1,
        "identifier": "default",
        "translations": {
            "en": {
                "name": "Standard Product"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

And now we need a new Manufacturer:

```shell
> http POST http://localhost:8000/api/shuup/manufacturer/ Authorization:"JWT YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" name="New Manufacturer" url=http://new-manuf.com

HTTP/1.0 201 Created
Allow: GET, POST, OPTIONS
Content-Language: en
Content-Type: application/json
Vary: Accept, Accept-Language, Cookie
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

{
    "created_on": "2017-01-02T18:30:30.549831Z",
    "id": 1,
    "name": "New Manufacturer",
    "url": "http://new-manuf.com"
}
```

**Note**: *Remember to use the* `application/json` *content type on your requests when using the API within your code.*
